For our purposes it is sufficient to give a loose characterization. A distributed system is one in which components located at networked computers communicate and coordinate their actions only by passing messages. This definition leads to the following especially significant characteristics of distributed systems: concurrency of components, lack of a global clock and independent failures of components.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"A distributed system is a collection of independent computers that appears to its users as a single coherent system. This definition has several important aspects. The first one is that a distributed system consists of components (i.e., computers) that are autonomous. A second aspect is that users (be they people or programs) think they are dealing with a single system. This means that one way or the other the autonomous components need to collaborate. How to establish this collaboration lies at the heart of developing distributed systems. Note that no assumptions are made concerning the type of computers. In principle, even within a single system, they could range from high-performance mainframe computers to small nodes in sensor networks. Likewise, no assumptions are made on the way that computers are interconnected. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Instead of going further with definitions, it is perhaps more useful to concentrate on important characteristics of distributed systems. One important characteristic is that differences between the various computers and the ways in which they communicate are mostly hidden from users. The same holds for the internal organization of the distributed system. Another important characteristic is that users and applications can interact with a distributed system in a consistent and uniform way, regardless of where and when interaction takes place. \"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In principle, distributed systems should also be relatively easy to expand or scale. This characteristic is a direct consequence of having independent computers, but at the same time, hiding how these computers actually take part in the system as a whole. A distributed system will normally be continuously available, although perhaps some parts may be temporarily out of order. Users and applications should not notice that parts are being replaced or fixed, or that new parts are added to serve more users or applications.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"In order to support heterogeneous computers and networks while offering a single-system view, distributed systems are often organized by means of a layer of software-that is, logically placed between a higher-level layer consisting of users and applications, and a layer underneath consisting of operating systems and basic communication facilities, as shown in Figure.\"));\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;","tableOfContents":{},"frontmatter":{"title":"Distributed Systems Introduction","description":"Content for Distributed Systems"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"14f20f15-a0af-535c-916c-609444be099e"}}}
