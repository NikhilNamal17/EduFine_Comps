There are many reasons for wanting to share resources. One obvious reason is that of economics. For example, it is cheaper to let a printer be shared by several users in a smaJl office than having to buy and maintain a separate printer for each user. Likewise, it makes economic sense to share costly resources such as supercomputers, high-performance storage systems, imagesetters, and other expensive peripherals\"), mdx(\"h3\", {\n    \"id\": \"distribution-transparency\",\n    \"style\": {\n      \"position\": \"relative\"\n    }\n  }, \"Distribution Transparency\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"An important goal of a distributed system is to hide the fact that its processes and resources are physically distributed across multiple computers.

In distributed systems, services are generally specified through interfaces, which are often described in an Interface Definition Language (IDL). Interface definitions written in an IDL nearly always capture only the syntax of services. In other words, they specify precisely the names of the functions that are available together with types of the parameters, return values, possible exceptions that can be raised, and so on.
