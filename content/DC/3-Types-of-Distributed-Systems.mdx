Cluster computing systems became popular when the price/performance ratio of personal computers and workstations improved. At a certain point, it became financially and technically attractive to build a supercomputer using off-the-shelf technology by simply hooking up a collection of relatively simple computers in a high-speed network. In virtually all cases, cluster computing is used for parallel programming in which a single (compute intensive) program is run in parallel on multiple machines. 

One well-known example of a cluster computer is formed by Linux-based Beowulf clusters, of which the general configuration is shown in fig above. Each cluster consists of a collection of compute nodes that are controlled and accessed by means of a single master node. The master typically handles the allocation of nodes to a particular parallel program, maintains a batch queue of submitted jobs, and provides an interface for the users of the system. As such, the master actually runs the middleware needed for the execution of programs and management of the cluster, while the compute nodes often need nothing else but a standard operating system. 

An important part of this middleware is formed by the libraries for executing parallel programs, many of these libraries effectively provide only advanced message-based communication facilities, but are not capable of handling faulty processes, security, etc. As an alternative to this hierarchical organization, a symmetric approach is followed in the MOSIX system. MOSIX attempts to provide a single-system image of a cluster, meaning that to a process a cluster computer offers the ultimate distribution transparency by appearing to be a single computer. 

As we mentioned, providing such an image under all circumstances is impossible. In the case of MOSIX, the high degree of transparency is provided by allowing processes to dynamically and preemptively migrate between the nodes that make up the cluster. Process migration allows a user to start an application on any node (referred to as the home node), after which it can transparently move to other nodes, for example, to make efficient use of resources. 

### Grid Computing Systems

A characteristic feature of cluster computing is its homogeneity. In most cases, the computers in a cluster are largely the same, they all have the same operating system, and are all connected through the same network. In contrast, grid computing systems have a high degree of heterogeneity: no assumptions are made concerning hardware, operating systems, networks, administrative domains, security policies, etc. 

A key issue in a grid computing system is that resources from different organizations are brought together to allow the collaboration of a group of people or institutions. Such a collaboration is realized in the form of a virtual organization. The people belonging to the same virtual organization have access rights to the resources that are provided to that organization. Typically, resources consist of compute servers (including supercomputers, possibly implemented as cluster computers), storage facilities, and databases. In addition, special networked devices such as telescopes, sensors, etc., can be provided as well. 

A layered architecture for grid computing systems consists of four layers. The lowest fabric layer provides interfaces to local resources at a specific site. Note that these interfaces are tailored to allow sharing of resources within a virtual organization. Typically, they will provide functions for querying the state and capabilities of a resource, along with functions for actual resource management (e.g., locking resources). The connectivity layer consists of communication protocols for supporting grid transactions that span the usage of multiple resources. For example, protocols are needed to transfer data between resources, or to simply access a resource from a remote location. In addition, the connectivity layer will contain security protocols to authenticate users and resources. 

Note that in many cases human users are not authenticated; instead, programs acting on behalf of the users are authenticated. In this sense, delegating rights from a user to programs is an important function that needs to be supported in the connectivity layer. We return extensively to delegation when discussing security in distributed systems. The resource layer is responsible for managing a single resource. It uses the functions provided by the connectivity layer and calls directly the interfaces made available by the fabric layer. For example, this layer will offer functions for obtaining configuration information on a specific resource, or, in general, to perform specific operations such as creating a process or reading data. 

The resource layer is thus seen to be responsible for access control, and hence will rely on the authentication performed as part of the connectivity layer. The next layer in the hierarchy is the collective layer. It deals with handling access to multiple resources and typically consists of services for resource discovery, allocation and scheduling of tasks onto multiple resources, data replication, and so on. Unlike the connectivity and resource layer, which consist of a relatively small, standard collection of protocols, the collective layer may consist of many different protocols for many different purposes, reflecting the broad spectrum of services it may offer to a virtual organization.

Finally, the application layer consists of the applications that operate within a virtual organization and which make use of the grid computing environment. Typically the collective, connectivity, a and resource layer form the heart of what could be called a grid middleware layer. These layers jointly provide access to and management of resources that are potentially dispersed across multiple sites. An important observation from a middleware perspective is that with grid computing the notion of a site (or administrative unit) is common. This prevalence is emphasized by the gradual shift toward a service-oriented architecture in which sites offer access to the various layers through a collection of web services.

### Distributed Information Systems
Another important class of distributed systems is found in organizations that were confronted with a wealth of networked applications, but for which interoperability turned out to be a painful experience. Many of the existing middleware solutions are the result of working with an infrastructure in which it was easier to integrate applications into an enterprise-wide information system. We can distinguish several levels at which integration took place. In many cases, a networked application simply consisted of a server running that application (often including a database) and making it available to remote programs, called clients. Such clients could send a request to the server for executing a specific operation, after which a response would be sent back. 

Integration at the lowest level would allow clients to wrap a number of requests, possibly for different servers, into a single larger request and have it executed as a distributed transaction. The key idea was that all, or none of the requests would be executed. As applications became more sophisticated and were gradually separated into independent components (notably distinguishing database components from processing components), it became clear that integration should also take place by letting applications communicate directly with each other. This has now led to a huge industry that concentrates on enterprise application integration (EAl). In the following, we concentrate on these two forms of distributed systems.
