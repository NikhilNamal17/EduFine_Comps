### Making Resources Accessible 
The main goal of a distributed system is to make it easy for the users (and applications) to access remote resources, and to share them in a controlled and efficient way. Resources can be just about anything, but typical examples include 4 INTRODUCTION CHAP. 1 things like printers, computers, storage facilities, data, files, Web pages, and networks, to name just a few. There are many reasons for wanting to share resources. One obvious reason is that of economics. For example, it is cheaper to let a printer be shared by several users in a smaJl office than having to buy and maintain a separate printer for each user. Likewise, it makes economic sense to share costly resources such as supercomputers, high-performance storage systems, imagesetters, and other expensive peripherals

### Distribution Transparency 
An important goal of a distributed system is to hide the fact that its processes and resources are physically distributed across multiple computers. A distributed system that is able to present itself to users and applications as if it were only a single computer system is said to be transparent. Let us first take a look at what kinds of transparency exist in distributed systems. After that we will address the more general question whether transparency is always required.

### Openness
Another important goal of distributed systems is openness. An open distributed system is a system that offers services according to standard rules that describe the syntax and semantics of those services. For example, in computer networks, standard rules govern the format, contents, and meaning of messages sent and received. Such rules are formalized in protocols. In distributed systems, services are generally specified through interfaces, which are often described in an Interface Definition Language (IDL). Interface definitions written in an IDL nearly always capture only the syntax of services. In other words, they specify precisely the names of the functions that are available together with types of the parameters, return values, possible exceptions that can be raised, and so on. The hard part is specifying precisely what those services do, that is, the semantics of interfaces. In practice, such specifications are always given in an informal way by means of natural language.

### Scalability 
Worldwide connectivity through the Internet is rapidly becoming as common as being able to send a postcard to anyone anywhere around the world. With this in mind, scalability is one of the most important design goals for developers of distributed systems. Scalability of a system can be measured along at least three different dimensions (Neuman, 1994). 

1.	A system can be scalable with respect to its size, meaning that we can easily add more users and resources to the system. 
2.	A geographically scalable system is one in which the users and resources may lie far apart. 
3.	A system can be administratively scalable and it can still be easy to manage even if it spans many independent administrative organizations. 

Unfortunately, a system that is scalable in one or more of these dimensions often exhibits some loss of performance as the system scales up.
